Oh, Hello, world;
I'm a coder, at least now. In my code, ";" is everywhere. there is not a "." in any code end. I want to use this to record my mind, my life ,every inspiration and my thoughts. I hope it will be an endless project. I hope my life is long enough and this repo will be useful for me.
And, I hope my life is better than yesterday everyday. I need grow up in every "hello world".
Today is 11.11 an special day for Chinese due to Jack Ma. It's is a single day before, but a buying day now. 
It's never too late to start, but now is a best time. not tomorrow.
OK, let's start it.
donkeyears, endless hello world.
